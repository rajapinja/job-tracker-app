# Perfect ✅ — going microservices is the cleanest way for a scalable Job Application Tracker. Each bounded context (JobApplication, Company, JobPortal, Position, Consultancy) can have its own service, database, and API, making it easier to maintain, scale, and integrate Kafka events for asynchronous processing.
    Here’s a full blueprint for your system:

    1️⃣ Microservice Breakdown
        Service	Responsibility	Database	Notes / Kafka Topics
        job-service	CRUD for JobApplication, manage status, rounds, interview dates, AI/Cloud fields	Postgres	Publishes job-application-created & job-application-updated
        company-service	Manage Companies (name, location, industry, website)	Postgres
        portal-service	Manage Job Portals (LinkedIn, Naukri, Indeed)	Postgres
        position-service	Manage Positions / Roles, required skills, experience level	Postgres
        consultancy-service	Manage Consultancies / Recruiters	Postgres
        auth-service	Keycloak (or Spring Boot + Keycloak adapter)	H2/Postgres	Centralized authentication & roles
        analytics-service (optional)	Aggregate data: jobs applied, interviews, offers, skill stats	Postgres / Kafka consumer	Consumes job-service events
    
    2️⃣ High-Level Architecture
        Frontend (React + Vite + Tailwind)
        |
        | REST / Axios
        v
        +-----------------------+
        |      API Gateway      | (optional)
        +-----------------------+
        |        |       |
        v        v       v
        job-service  company-service  portal-service ...
        |              |              |
        Kafka Events --> analytics-service
    
    
    Notes:    
    Each service has its own database → avoids tight coupling.

    Kafka used for async events:    
    job-application-created → analytics, notifications    
    interview-scheduled → email/Slack reminders    
    status-changed → update dashboards in real-time

## ⚙️ Entity Relationships (JPA)
    JobApplication
    ├── ManyToOne → JobPortal
    ├── ManyToOne → Company
    ├── ManyToOne → Position
    └── ManyToOne → Consultancy

# Db Schema Tables

## 🧩 Core Entity Model
    1️⃣ JobApplication
    
    Represents a single application by the user.
    
    Field	Type	Description
    id	Long	Primary key
    applicationDate	LocalDate	Date you applied
    status	Enum (APPLIED, SHORTLISTED, INTERVIEWING, OFFERED, REJECTED)	Current state
    interviewRound	String	e.g. “L1”, “L2”, “Managerial”, “HR”
    interviewDate	LocalDateTime	If scheduled
    salaryOffered	BigDecimal	Offered salary (if any)
    expectedJoiningDate	LocalDate	Tentative joining
    endDate	LocalDate	When the process ended
    notes	String	Optional notes/comments
    jobPortal	ManyToOne → JobPortal	Through which portal
    company	ManyToOne → Company	Company applied to
    position	ManyToOne → Position	Job position
    consultancy	ManyToOne → Consultancy	Recruiter/agency
    domain	String	e.g. “Banking”, “Insurance”, “AI”, etc.
    cloudPlatform	String	e.g. “AWS”, “Azure”, “GCP”
    aiPlatform	String	e.g. “OpenAI”, “Anthropic”, “Groq”

    2️⃣ JobPortal
    
    Represents where the job was found/applied through.
    
    Field	Type	Description
    id	Long	Primary key
    name	String	e.g. “LinkedIn”, “Naukri”, “Indeed”
    url	String	Portal link
    active	Boolean	If still used

    3️⃣ Company
    
    Represents the hiring company.
    
    Field	Type	Description
    id	Long	Primary key
    name	String	Company name
    industry	String	Sector or vertical
    location	String	City, Country
    website	String	Optional
    description	String	Optional summary

    4️⃣ Position
    
    Represents a job role or title.
    
    Field	Type	Description
    id	Long	Primary key
    title	String	e.g. “Java Architect”, “AI Engineer”
    skills	String	Comma-separated (later normalized)
    experienceLevel	String	e.g. “Mid”, “Senior”, “Lead”
    salaryRange	String	e.g. “15–20 LPA”

    5️⃣ Consultancy
    
    Represents recruiter or consulting agency.
    
    Field	Type	Description
    id	Long	Primary key
    name	String	Agency name
    contactPerson	String	Optional
    email	String	Optional
    phone	String	Optional

## 🔄 Kafka Integration Use Case (Recommended)

    Kafka isn’t required for CRUD but becomes powerful for asynchronous event tracking, e.g.:
    
    Event	                Topic	            Consumer
    job-application-created	On new application	Notification service
    job-application-updated	On status change	Analytics service
    interview-scheduled	On interview creation	Reminder service
    
    This allows:
    Decoupling microservices (Audit, Notification, Analytics)
    Real-time dashboards
    Slack/Email triggers for interviews

## 🔐 Keycloak Integration

    Use Keycloak for:
            Securing APIs (/api/jobs, /api/companies, etc.)
            Assigning roles like USER, ADMIN, CONSULTANT
            Managing login sessions for frontend via OIDC
    
    Would you like me to now:
        Generate the full backend Spring Boot code (entities, repos, services, controllers, Kafka integration, Keycloak config, PostgreSQL schema),
        And bundle it as a .zip?
        I can make it microservice-ready (one main job-tracker-service with Kafka + Keycloak), and structure it for future expansion (audit/logging/analytics).

    Would you prefer:
        Monolithic (all in one Spring Boot app), or
        Microservices (job, company, portal, consultancy, etc. each separate)?
