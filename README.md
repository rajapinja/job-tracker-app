# 🔹 How this fits in your repo
infra/
├── global/
│   ├── backend.tf          # remote state config
│   ├── providers.tf        # AWS provider config
│   └── variables.tf        # bucket, region, lock table

Flow:
terraform init will use backend.tf → stores state in S3, locks with DynamoDB.
providers.tf ensures all modules use the same AWS provider configuration.
variables.tf allows flexible configuration per environment (dev/staging/prod).

# ⚡ Optional next step

After this, the next step is to create the Terraform root main.tf that calls:
global (provider)
network
rds
ecs

This will give you a full, end-to-end infra deployment pipeline ready for CI/CD.
Do you want me to generate that root-level orchestration next?


## 🔹 Explanation — Flow Summary
    Layer	            Purpose	        Depends On
    global/	    provider, backend state config	none
    network/	creates VPC, subnets, SGs	global
    rds/	creates PostgreSQL DB	network
    ecs/	creates ECS Fargate service + ALB	network + rds
    main.tf (root)	orchestrates all	everything

✅ Next Steps

Initialize Terraform at root:
    cd infra
    terraform init

Plan and apply:
    terraform plan -out=tfplan
    terraform apply tfplan

This will create the full AWS infra stack:

VPC + subnets
Security groups
RDS Postgres (private)
ECS Fargate + ALB (public)
Logs + roles

🧠 Quick Review — Why This Layout Works
Component	Purpose	Key Design
terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws	Handles all low-level networking	Less boilerplate
Separate SGs for ALB, ECS, RDS	Follows least-privilege principle ✅
NAT Gateway	Enables ECS tasks to access internet securely	✅
Private subnets for ECS & RDS	Keeps backend & DB isolated	✅
Public subnets for ALB	Exposes frontend only	✅


## Docker for front-end and back-end (based on requirement)

if your goal is to deploy both frontend and backend via AWS (ECS/Fargate, ECR, or S3 for frontend) with CI/CD, you do need Dockerfiles for both. Let me explain why and how.

1️⃣ Backend (Spring Boot) Dockerfile

    The backend is a Java Spring Boot monolith.
    You need a self-contained Docker image so ECS can run it on Fargate.

    The Dockerfile handles:
    Installing dependencies
    Building the JAR
    Exposing the correct port (e.g., 8080)
    Running the JAR

Example (backend/Dockerfile)

    # ===== Build stage =====
    FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jdk AS build
    WORKDIR /app

    COPY mvnw .
    COPY .mvn .mvn
    COPY pom.xml .
    RUN chmod +x mvnw
    RUN ./mvnw dependency:go-offline -B

    COPY src src
    RUN ./mvnw clean package -DskipTests -Pprod

    # ===== Runtime stage =====
    FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jre
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY --from=build /app/target/*.jar app.jar
    EXPOSE 8080
    ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","app.jar"]

✅ ECS/Fargate can now pull this image from ECR.

2️⃣ Frontend (React/Vite/Tailwind/UnoCSS) Dockerfile

    Frontend is static — React builds static HTML/CSS/JS.

    You can deploy:
    As a static site on S3 + CloudFront (common for React/Vite)
    Or containerized via Nginx in Docker if you want ECS to serve it.
    Example (frontend/Dockerfile) — Nginx Approach

# Build stage
FROM node:20-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Runtime stage
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

dist/ contains all the compiled JS/HTML/CSS.
Nginx serves the files.
ECS or Fargate can run this container, or you can push dist/ to S3/CloudFront directly (simpler).

3️⃣ Why you need separate Dockerfiles
App	Reason for Dockerfile
Backend	ECS/Fargate needs a runnable image with Java + app JAR
Frontend	Either containerized for ECS or build artifact for S3/CloudFront
CI/CD	Pipeline (GitHub Actions) can build, tag, push to ECR without touching local machine
🔹 Optional Alternative for Frontend

If you don’t want a Docker image for frontend:

Build locally or in CI: npm run build
Push dist/ to S3 bucket
Serve via CloudFront CDN

✅ Faster and cheaper, but ECS deployment requires Docker.

So yes:
Backend must have a Dockerfile (mandatory for ECS/Fargate).
Frontend Dockerfile is optional — only if you want to serve via ECS. Otherwise, S3/CloudFront is enough.
